This process requires the physical Yubikey, as well as the key's PIN. Finding the PIN requires that you have access to the certificate from the vendor at SSL.com.
For steps to find it, see here: https://www.ssl.com/how-to/access-your-yubikey-fips-pin-and-puk/


GUI METHOD:
Plug the Yubikey into a USB port on your computer. If you haven't previously acquired the Yubikey microdrivers, you'll need those first (see the link at the top for directions).

Use SSL Manager, downloaded via: https://www.ssl.com/ssl-manager/

From the top menu, select Code Signing > Sign & Codestamp Code Package

Select the Input file, and for the Code Signing Certificate, select from Store and use "Quorum Outreach and Research Foundation"
(you may need to select "more options" or something similar to find it)

Leave Certificate Password blank. Use SSL.com Timestamping Service for the timestamp.

Select output destination and provide the Yubikey's PIN.



CONSOLE METHOD:
This method uses SignTool, which is included in the Windows SDK. 
With the key plugged into your machine, and with the Yubi Key Microdrivers installed, use this command:

"C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\bin\10.0.22621.0\x86\signtool.exe" sign /fd sha256 /a "C:\path\to\unsigned\Quorum-Studio-Windows.exe"

Note that, depending on your version of the Windows SDK on the machine, you will likely need to change the path to SignTool.
Also, this command tries to automatically detect the correct key. If the command produces errors, you may need to explicitly indicate the certificate cccccbnvrvkcfghdihnntdrvnbbejirubvedleehdeie
to use.
